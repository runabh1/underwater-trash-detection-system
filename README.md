## Installation

### Option 1: Flask Web Application
1. **Clone or download this project** to your local machine

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure your model file is in place**:
   - Make sure `best.pt` is in the root directory of the project

### Option 2: Streamlit Application (Recommended)
1. **Clone or download this project** to your local machine

2. **Install Streamlit dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_streamlit.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure your model file is in place**:
   - Make sure `best.pt` is in the root directory of the project

## Usage

### Flask Web Application
1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Streamlit Application (Recommended)
1. **Start the Streamlit application**:
   ```bash
   python run_streamlit.py
   ```
   Or directly:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

3. **Choose your detection method**:

   ### Video Upload
   - Click "Choose Video File" or drag and drop a video file
   - Supported formats: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV
   - Adjust processing parameters:
     - **Frame Skip Interval**: Process every Nth frame (1 = all frames, 5 = every 5th frame)
     - **Confidence Threshold**: Minimum confidence for detection (0.1 = 10%, 0.9 = 90%)
     - **Max Detections**: Maximum number of detections to show per frame
   - Click "Process Video" to analyze the video
   - View results in the grid below
   - Click "Recreate Video with Detections" to download the processed video with detection overlays

   ### Live Webcam Detection
   - Click "Start Webcam" to begin live detection
   - Allow camera access when prompted
   - Adjust confidence threshold and max detections for real-time processing
   - Real-time detection results will appear on the video feed
   - Click "Stop Webcam" to end the session

## How It Works

### Video Processing
1. Upload a video file through the web interface
2. The system processes every 5th frame to optimize performance
3. Your YOLO model detects trash in each frame
4. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected objects
5. Results are displayed in a grid format with frame numbers and detection counts
6. Use the "Recreate Video" feature to download the processed video with detection overlays

### Live Detection
1. Start the webcam through the browser
2. Frames are captured and sent to the server every second
3. Your model processes each frame in real-time
4. Detection results are overlaid on the video feed
5. Green bounding boxes show detected trash with confidence scores

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Flask web server with OpenCV and YOLO integration
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with modern web APIs
- **Model**: Uses Ultralytics YOLO for object detection
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV for frame extraction and processing
- **Real-time**: WebRTC for webcam access and real-time processing

## Customization

### Model Configuration
- The system automatically loads your `best.pt` model file
- Detection confidence thresholds can be adjusted in `app.py`
- Frame processing frequency can be modified (currently every 5th frame)

### Trash Class Configuration
- Trash classes and their colors can be customized in `trash_classes.py`
- The system supports 15 different trash types as trained in your model
- Each trash type has its own color for easy identification

### UI Customization
- Ocean theme colors can be modified in the CSS section of `templates/index.html`
- Animation speeds and effects can be adjusted
- Grid layout and card styling can be customized

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model not loading**:
   - Ensure `best.pt` is in the correct location
   - Check that the file is not corrupted

2. **Webcam not working**:
   - Ensure your browser supports WebRTC
   - Check camera permissions in your browser
   - Try using HTTPS (required for webcam in some browsers)

3. **Video upload fails**:
   - Check file format (MP4, AVI, MOV supported)
   - Ensure file size is reasonable
   - Check server logs for specific error messages

4. **Performance issues**:
   - Reduce video resolution for faster processing
   - Increase frame skip interval in `app.py`
   - Use a more powerful machine for large videos

### Error Messages

- **"No video file provided"**: Ensure you've selected a video file
- **"Model loading error"**: Check that `best.pt` exists and is valid
- **"Webcam access denied"**: Grant camera permissions in your browser

## Performance Tips

- For large videos, consider processing in smaller segments
- Adjust the frame processing interval based on your needs
- Use GPU acceleration if available (requires CUDA setup)
- Optimize video resolution before upload for faster processing
